      <p>
      Hi! I’m <a href="https://github.com/Sanjay17u" target="_blank">Sanjay</a>, a passionate web developer with a focus on building dynamic and responsive web applications. I Build this MERN-stack project called EventNest, an event planning platform designed to help users organize events like weddings, birthdays, office parties, and more.

      With React on the front-end and the MERN-stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) on the back-end, I’m creating an intuitive and seamless experience for users to plan and manage their special events.

      I am always looking to learn new technologies, improve my skills, and build innovative solutions to real-world problems.

      Feel free to <a href="sanjay.solanki.17.om@gmail.com" target="_blank" title="Email: sanjay.solanki.17.om@gmail.com">connect</a> with me  if you want to collaborate or just chat about coding and tech!
